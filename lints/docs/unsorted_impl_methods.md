# `oneway::unsorted_impl_methods`

**Severity:** deny
**Enforced by:** `oneway_lints` (dylint)

Methods within an `impl` block must appear in this order:

1. **Static methods / constructors** — anything without a `self` receiver
2. **Public methods** — `self` receiver with `pub` (or `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, …)
3. **Private methods** — `self` receiver with no visibility modifier

Within each group, methods must be alphabetically sorted.

## Rationale

The grouping reflects how a reader scans a type: first, "how do I make one?" (constructors), then "what can I do with it from outside?" (public), then "implementation detail" (private). Without grouping, public API and private helpers interleave and the reader has to filter mentally on every scan. The alphabetical pin within each group eliminates ordering debates and keeps diffs minimal.

## ❌ Bad — public method appears before constructor

```rust
impl User {
    pub fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self { Self { name } }
}
```

## ❌ Bad — within the public group, methods are not alphabetical

```rust
impl User {
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self { Self { name } }
    pub fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    pub fn email(&self) -> &str { &self.email }
}
```

## ✅ Good

```rust
impl User {
    pub fn from_email(email: String) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self { /* ... */ }

    pub fn email(&self) -> &str { &self.email }
    pub fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }

    fn cache_key(&self) -> String { /* ... */ }
    fn validate(&self) -> bool { /* ... */ }
}
```
